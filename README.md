Firebolt GO driver is an implementation of `database/sql/driver`.

### Installation

```shell
go get github.com/firebolt-db/firebolt-go-sdk
```

### Example
Here is an example of establishing a connection and executing a simple select query. 
For it to run successfully, you have to specify your credentials, and have a default engine up and running.

```go
package main

import (
	"database/sql"
	"fmt"
	// we need to import firebolt-go-sdk, so it is able to register its driver
	_ "github.com/firebolt-db/firebolt-go-sdk"
)

func main() {

	// constructing a dsn string, you need to set your credentials
	clientId := ""
	clientSecret := ""
	accountName := ""
	databaseName := ""
	dsn := fmt.Sprintf("firebolt:///%s?account_name=%s&client_id=%s&client_secret=%s", databaseName, accountName, clientId, clientSecret)

	// opening the firebolt driver
	db, err := sql.Open("firebolt", dsn)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("error during opening a driver: %v", err)
	}

	// executing a simple select query
	rows, err := db.Query("SELECT 1 UNION SELECT 2")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("error during select query: %v", err)
	}

	// iterating over the resulting rows
	defer rows.Close()
	for rows.Next() {
		var id int
		if err := rows.Scan(&id); err != nil {
			fmt.Println("error during scan: %v", err)
		}
		fmt.Println(id)
	}
}
```


### DSN (Data source name)
All information for the connection should be specified using the DSN string. The firebolt dsn string has the following format:  
```
firebolt://username:password@database[/engine_name][?account_name=account_name]
```

- **username** - the email address you use to log in to Firebolt.
- **password** - your password to log in to Firebolt.
- **database** - the Firebolt database to connect to.
- **engine_url** - the url of the engine to run SQL on. Alternatively engine_name could be specified here, in this case, the engine url will be retrieved automatically. If omitted, the default engine for the database is used. 
- **account_name** - the Firebolt account to log in to.

You need to escape some characters with double backslashes, e.g. if you have a `@` sign in the password, you should write `\\@`.

### Limitations
Although, all interfaces are available, not all of them are implemented or could be implemented:
- `driver.Result` is a dummy implementation and doesn't return the real result values.
- Both `Exec` and `Query` accept arguments for prepared statements, but aren't implemented, and will panic
